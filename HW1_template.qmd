# Overview

This assignment asks you to get practice with `ggplot2` using data sets built into the `ggplot2` package. Because the YAML heder contains the option `echo: true`, whenever you render your Quarto document, it will contain your R commands, the R output and your narrative text. Submit by pushing to your GitHub repository. You are required to have at least 3 commits. I recommend that the first be after you have replaced "Your Name" with your actual name in the YAML header above.

# Make the Plot You See

In questions 1-6 below, use the specified data set to create the plot shown. Be sure to double-check the data set name for each problem.

1)  Use **mtcars** to reproduce this figure.

![](figs/q1fig.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

2)  Use **mpg** to reproduce this figure.

![](figs/q2fig.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

3)  Use **airquality** to reproduce this figure.

![](figs/q3fig.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

4)  Use **mpg** to reproduce this figure.

![](figs/q4fig.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

5)  Use **airquality** to reproduce this figure.

![](figs/q5fig.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

6)  Use **mpg** to reproduce this figure.

![](figs/q6fig.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

# Create Plots to Explore the Diamonds Data

In questions 7-10 below, use the **diamonds** data from **ggplot2** to create the type of plot specified.[^1]

[^1]: Use `?diamonds` to read about the data set.

7)  Create a plot of counts for a discrete variable in the **diamonds** data set.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

8)  Create a histogram or density plot of a continuous variable in the **diamonds** data set.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

9)  Using the **diamonds** data, create a scatterplot of two continuous variables, with a smoothing line overlaid.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

10) Using the **diamonds** data, create overlaid density plots with alpha transparency like the one shown [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png) for the **penguins** data.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```
